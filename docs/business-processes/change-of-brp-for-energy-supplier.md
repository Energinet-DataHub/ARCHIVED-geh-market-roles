# Change of BRP for Energy Supplier

This process is used by the Green Energy Hub to change BRP for consumption and production metering points.

For production metering points, the BRP can be changed for either the entire grid area or one or more selected metering points in a grid area, as an energy supplier may have several BRPs in a grid area.
