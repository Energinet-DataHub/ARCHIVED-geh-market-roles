# Forward contact address by Grid Access Provider

If a grid access provider has contact address information that has not been received from the energy supplier, the grid access provider may choose to notify the energy supplier. This is done using this process. The energy supplier decides whether or not the contact addresses should be used, and they are therefore not recorded in GEH.
